        description: 'The Crowntail Betta is one of the most popular freshwater fish. This species is relatively young, first bred by Ahmad Yusuf in Indonesia around 25 years ago. The fins of this species have a long spikey crown appearance, however if the webbing reaches more than 2/3 up the tail then it is classified as a different type – the Combtail Betta. While the males show striking colors with long fins and tail, female look quite different. Usually the female has lighter colors with a shorter tail with a less majestic overall appearance.',

It comes in many different colors variations and the overall appearance is quite remarkable.

She does not have any of the remarkable characteristics of the male but sometimes has bright colors. Females tend to have lighter colorations and short fins and tail.',
